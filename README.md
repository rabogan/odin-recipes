A Simple Refresher on Website Building

The current project is just a simple (no CSS website) that displays a bunch of recipes.  Practice the use of Git from the command line

In case you have trouble remembering,
it's:
git add (file name)
git commit -m "Add message following the seven rules"
git push (To move it to the Git Repository)
